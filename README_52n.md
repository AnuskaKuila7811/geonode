# 52°North Fork of GeoNode

This image is built from a fork of [Geonode](https://github.com/geonode/geonode).
[52°North GmbH](https://52north.org) maintains an own fork of GeoNode in order to make necessary adjustments within projects which are not part of GeoNode core.

However, we are interested to stay as close to upstream as possible, to benefit from ongoing development, but also to contribute features and fixes we develop in our projects.

This image is built from the `52n-master` branch of the [`52north/geonode` repository](https://github.com/52North/geonode/tree/52n-master).
Depending on our current project contexts we merge regularly from upstream, and create new pull requests from this fork.
